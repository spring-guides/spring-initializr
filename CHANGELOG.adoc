The _default_ instance of Spring Initializr (i.e. link:https://start.spring.io[]) is using the continuous deployment
technique: when a new feature or a bug is fixed, pushing the code to master leads to a job that runs all the
tests and update the application live if they all pass.

Because of that, it may be hard to track what has changed; this page provides a summary of changes in descending
order.

=== Release 1.0.0 (In progress)

* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/65[#65]: project archives generated by the web UI now contain
a base directory equals to the `artifactId`. By default, no base directory gets created if the project is
generated by another means; use the new `baseDir` to control that behaviour.
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/46[#46]: projects generated against Spring 1.2+ are using the
new `@SpringBootApplication`
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/64[#64]: Groovy-based projects are now working properly with
Java 8; update Groovy compiler to 2.3
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/60[#60]: the name of the application is now generated against
the `name` property. As a result the new default name is now `DemoApplication` instead of `Application`. If the
specified name contains invalid java identifier character, `Application` is used as a fallback
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/52[#52]: the home page now shows a reference to the Github project
* Move the `<properties>` section of the pom higher so that it has a better visibility
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/57[#57]: fix wrong dependency metric when a project is generated
with no explicit dependency
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/51[#51]: use `https` for artifact repositories
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/50[#50]: `dependencies` is now an alias of the `style` parameter.
As a result, https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?dependencies=web has the same effect as
https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?style=web
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/49[#49]: update metadata format to v2. The updated metadata format
is now more descriptive and HAL-compliant and can be used with Spring HATEOAS to build a client. Metadata v1 is still
served to preserve backward compatibility with Spring Boot CLI 1.2.0.RC1.
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/43[#43]: add _tag_ section to the `type` element to express more
metadata about a particular type
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/38[#38]: associate a more meaningful HTTP status code for well-known
exception types. Previously `500` was wrongly used for all of them.
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/41[#41]: fix potential NPE with unknown Spring Boot starter
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/40[#40]: add support for dependency description
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/36[#36]: the name of the project archive now depends on the value
of the `artifactId` attribute. As a result, the default archive name is no longer `starter.zip` but `demo.zip`
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/32[#32]: add specific metrics, available from the `/metrics` endpoint
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/26[#26]: available Spring Boot versions are now retrieved from
spring.io; it is no longer necessary to refresh the configuration and redeploy the instance when a new Spring Boot
release is available
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/33[#33]: older STS version can now use the Spring Boot project
wizard again
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/31[#31]: the `/spring` endpoint now redirects to the official
repository location to use to download the latest CLI bundle
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/30[#30]: add support for dependency `facet`. A facet is a simple
name that can be used to further tune the project request if necessary.
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/29[#29]: add dependency alias support. A dependency can have an
arbitrary number of aliases. A project can be generated using that dependency either referring to its main id or
any of its registered aliases.
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/17[#17]: add support for non Spring Boot starter dependency. A
dependency can also be defined using `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version`
* https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/19[#19]: add more configurable defaults: `groupId`, `artifactId`,
`version`, `name`, `description` and `packageName`
