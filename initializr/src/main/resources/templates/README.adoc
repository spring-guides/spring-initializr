== My cool new Spring Boot app!

This app uses Spring Boot. You have picked:
<% resolvedDependencies.each { %>
* ${it.name}<% } %>

These modules manifest as various http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter-poms["starters"] in your build file.

=== Getting Help

Some key bits of documentation regarding your choices:
<% resolvedDependencies.each {  it.refdocs.each { %>
* ${it}<% } } %>
<% if (build.equals('gradle')) {%>* http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-gradle-plugin[Spring Boot Gradle Plugin]<%} else if (build.equals('maven')) {%>* http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin[Spring Boot Maven Plugin]<%}%>

=== What do I do with this file?

This file is a helper to get started. Once your project is up and running, feel free to clean it out and plug in details
about your application. It's written in asciidoctor, which is nicely supported by GitHub if you commit it as README.adoc.

Happy coding!
