# Spring Initializr

## Prerequisites

You need Java (1.6 or better) and a bash-like shell.

If you are on a Mac and using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), all you need to do to install it is:

    $ brew tap pivotal/tap
    $ brew install springboot

It will install `/usr/local/bin/spring`. You can jump right to [running the app](#running_the_app).

An alternative way to install the `spring` command line interface can be installed like this:

    $ curl start.spring.io/install.sh | bash

After running that command you should see a `spring` directory:

    $ ./spring/bin/spring --help

    usage: spring [--help] [--version]
       <command> [<args>]
    ...

You could add that `bin` directory to your `PATH` (the examples below
assume you did that).

If you don't have `curl` or `zip` you can probably get them (for
Windows users we recommend [cygwin](http://cygwin.org)), or you can
download the [zip file](http://start.spring.io/spring.zip) and unpack
it yourself.

## Project structure

Initializr is a library that provides all the default features and a service with a very simple script
that uses the auto-configuration feature of Spring Boot. All you need is _grabbing_ the library and
create a proper configuration file with the following script:

```
package org.acme.myapp

@Grab('io.spring.initalizr:initializr:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT')
class InitializerService { }
```

As a reference, `initializr-service` represents the _default_ service that runs at http://start.spring.io

<a name="running_the_app"></a>
## Running the tests
    
    $ cd initializr
    $ mvn test -P springMilestone
    
## Running the app locally

First make sure that you have built the library:

    $ cd initializr
    $ mvn clean install
    
The "springMilestone" profile might be needed to bootstrap your local Maven cache:

    $ mvn clean install -P springMilestone

Once you have done that, you can easily start the app using the spring command from the `initializr-service`
directory (`cd ../initializr-service`):

    $ spring run app.groovy

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

If you are on a Mac and using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), install the Cloud Foundry CLI:

    $ brew install cloudfoundry-cli

Alternatively, download a suitable binary for your platform from [Pivotal Web Services](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools).

An example Cloud Foundry `manifest.yml` file is provided. You should ensure that
the application name and URL (name and host values) are suitable for your environment
before running `cf push`.

You can jar up the app and make it executable in any environment.

    $ spring jar start.jar app.groovy

## Building an Executable JAR

The safest way to deploy to do is jar up the app and make it executable in any
environment. Care is needed with the includes and excludes:

    $ cf push start -p start.jar -n start-<space>
    
Where `<space>` is the name of the space. As a failsafe, and a
reminder to be explicit, the deployment will fail in production
without the `-n`. It is needed to select the route because there is a
manifest that defaults it to `start-development`.

If you are deploying the "legacy" service for STS in production:

    $ cf push start-legacy -p start.jar -n start-legacy
